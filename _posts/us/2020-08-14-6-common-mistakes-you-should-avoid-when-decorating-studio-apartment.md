## Avoid those mistakes when decorating a studio apartment

When looking for small apartment ideas to design the interior, one might make several mistakes. Some of them are barely noticeable, whereas others might turn everyday return from work into a nightmare. If you're not thrilled by this scenario, remember - to win the battle, you should know your enemy. It's the same in this particular case. **if you analyze the mistakes that might arise during a small apartment decoration, you will be able to avoid them.**

### Poorly chosen lighting

Wrong lighting is a common problem - not only for small apartments, but also larger interiors. Lack of natural lighting, not enough artificial lighting sources or their wrong planning - **those are issues affecting 30% of the whole population.** Where do those difficulties come from?

To estimate how many light points are needed, you should carefully analyze your project. **The lighting should help along everyday activities.** To choose the right lamp or even think about placing it, you have to know the exact spots at which you are going to prepare meals or read books.

**Lights arrangement mistakes arise because few think holistically at this stage.** Instead, one adopts general schemes: the main lamp hanging in the middle, some lights on the wall. Meanwhile, small apartments tend to be unusual in terms of structure, and certain pieces of equipment do not always stand in the most obvious spots. This way you might accidentally fall into trap.

### Too large furniture or... too much furniture

One cann be certain of one thing: if you decide on a small apartment, you will probably have to forget about a large living room set you could spend time watching TV series on. **A small, stylish sofa or a corner settee** will be far more functional.

The size of the furniture is not always the problem - the number of pieces might be also an issue. Keep in mind that small apartments do not have enough space to put any equipment in them. It might easily lead to clutter - and that's not the point, after all.

Think carefully what do you really need. **Choose accessories that complement each other, forming a consistent, but not overwhelmed space.** This way you can achieve a well organized and functional interior.

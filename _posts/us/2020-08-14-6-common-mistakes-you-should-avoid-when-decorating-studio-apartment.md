## Avoid those mistakes when decorating a studio apartment

When looking for **small apartment ideas** to design the interior, one might make several mistakes. Some of them are barely noticeable, whereas others might turn everyday return from work into a nightmare. If you're not thrilled by this scenario, remember - to win the battle, you should know your enemy. It's the same in this particular case. **If you analyze the mistakes that might arise during a small apartment decoration, you will be able to avoid them.**

### Poorly chosen lighting

Wrong lighting is a common problem - not only for small apartments, but also larger interiors. Lack of natural lighting, not enough artificial lighting sources or their wrong planning - **those are issues affecting 30% of the whole population.** Where do those difficulties come from?

To estimate how many light points are needed, you should carefully analyze your project. **The lighting should help along everyday activities.** To choose the right lamp or even think about placing it, you have to know the exact spots at which you are going to prepare meals or read books.

**Lights arrangement mistakes arise because few think holistically at this stage.** Instead, one adopts general schemes: the main lamp hanging in the middle, some lights on the wall. Meanwhile, small apartments tend to be unusual in terms of structure, and certain pieces of equipment do not always stand in the most obvious spots. This way you might accidentally fall into a trap.

### Too large furniture or... too much furniture

A studioo apartment might be difficult to furnish because it's not easy to estimate the right size of the furniture.  **Many homeowners wonder whether all the elements will fit in there - and more importantly, how will they look like.**

One cann be certain of one thing: if you decide on a small apartment, you will probably have to forget about a large living room set you could spend time watching TV series on. **A small, stylish sofa or a corner settee** will be far more functional.

Instead of free-standing furniture, you could also **choose custom furniture designs.** Thanks to this solution, you can spare a lot of space. They also might look far better.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}

The size of the furniture is not always the problem - the number of pieces might be also an issue. Keep in mind that small apartments do not have enough space to put any equipment in them. It might easily lead to clutter - and that's not the point, after all.

Think carefully what do you really need. **Choose accessories that complement each other, forming a consistent but not overwhelmed space.** This way you can achieve a well organized and functional interior.

### No space for storage

Small apartments designs require more attention mostly because of the need for **storage**. Unfortunately, if you design your studio apartment yourself - it's something easy to forget.

**A studio apartment design should include clever and functional closet or cabinet systems.** It's perfect if there are recessed walls in the studio apartment. Although it seems they disrupt the general look of the interior, they might be helpful in this particular case. They are ideal for a in-wall closet. Even if it's not very large, you can fit at least some of your belongings inside.

There's not enough space for such a solution? Try something else. Some elements can be stored inside the furniture. Pouffes with storage are a perfect examples. On one hand, one can sit on them, and on the other - you could keep some sheets, towels or winter scarfs and beanies in them. The market also offers **coffee tables with drawers**. You can use one to store CDs, books or electronic gadgets.

### A multitude of styles, textures and colors

A small studio apartment does not like chaos, therefore using many styles, textures and colors will not be effective in this case. **Before decorating your small apartment, it's advised to decide upon one main theme.** Matching strong colors might create an effect of an overflow. When entering the apartment, one will not be able to focus on one thing. It not only does not look well, but also has a negative impact on the mood.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}

A mixture of various elements might work well in some cases, e.g. when you decorate an apartment in vintage style. It tends to draw inspiration from various notions. However, it's not a recommended style for small apartments.

### Sticking by designs presented in catalogs

**Studio apartments designs look fantastic in sales catalogs.** Keep in mind, however, that they don't fully reflect what it's going to look like in your case. A tiny difference in the studio apartment layout or size - and the brilliant design will look completely different - not always better.

Hence, you **shouldn't transfer everything 1:1 to you own interior.** Draw inspiration from specialists, but don't treat it as a stiff canon that you cannot alter.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}

It's a good idea to choose several projects that you really like and analyze them. Mark something that is particularly attractive to you and something that you dislike in each of the designs. Using the method of trial and error, try to match individual elements. This way you have a chance to create a unique project that will fit your interior perfectly.

### Excessive order

When you enter some apartments, do they seem **exceptionally sterile** to you - a neat row of furniture by the wall, an empty space in the middle? It doesn't look good at all - just like a surplus of elements. What's more, by leaving an empty area in the middle, you waste space that could be used in a functional way.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}

If you don't have any idea on how to decorate a studio apartment and its central area, start from placing a sofa in the middle. It might become a starting point for further changes.

## How to decorate a studio apartment - with a specialist or by yourself?

A new apartment requires good planning from the beginning. At this stage, one can make a lot of mistakes that will affect the comfort of living in the future. Of course, you might **design everything drawing inspiration from the internet or sales catalogs.** It requires a lot of attention and takes a lot of time. Matching the right furniture, accessories and finishing materials might be problematic in some cases - even for a specialist. For this reason many homeowners consider hiring an interior designer.

**Thanks to modern graphic software, a specialist is able to prepare a draft of the project, along with a full visualization.** It will help you to get the idea how a particular interior might look like and allow you to implement necessary changes - without really affecting the apartment.

Are you wondering how much hiring a professional designer costs? It all depends on how big and complicated the project is. The full service usually involves designing a project and a supervision during the furnishing process. The more unusual the project, the higher the cost.

## A small balcony in an apartment - choose the power of plants

Plants always go well with home decor - regardless whether you have a small balcony or a larger deck. Before you choose any particular species, estimate how much space you have for your balcony garden. This way you can tell whether you can hang flower pots on the rail or put additional plants stands in various parts of the balcony.

**Blooming plants look beautiful in a city landscape, making it look more lively.** A balcony designed this way will surely catch the attention of anyone passing by.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}

When choosing balcony plants, pay attention not only to the available space, but also to the position of your balcony. Not every plant likes high exposure to sun, and some won't grow in shade.

## A small balcony in an apartment - a shaded spot for relaxation

You don't like too much sun, but you still like to rest on a balcony? In this case you should choose practical equipment. An **umbrella** is the basic element - its size should be matched with the size of your equipment. This way you can provide yourself some cool shade for comfortable relaxation.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}

Designing a balcony with a marquee is not always possible. A balcony in an apartment and any modifications to ot often require getting an approval from the housing association. It might happen that one cannot alter the shape of the building or its surface. In such a case your only option is an umbrella.

## Wooden floor on a small balcony - inspiration from nature

**The common standard for balcony floors is concrete or tiles.** It is, of course, a great solution, which is also exceptionally easy to clean. It doesn't, however, alway fit the general concept. For this reason many homeowners often decide to lay wood or wood-like material on the balcony.

It's a perfect choice if the balcony refers to nature with its style. **Pallet furniture, linen cushions, woven blankets, atmosperic lighting and wooden floor - those elements create really unique climate**, even in the center of a big bustling city.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}

If you're wondering which material to choose - natural wood or wood-like surface, consider two important factors. Natural wood is more expensive and more difficult to keep in the right condition. It needs more frequent and thorough maintenance. For this reason, most experts state that in this case synthetic material which looks just like wood is a better option.

## Designing a teen bedroom – by yourself or with an expert?

A teenage room and the whole proces of its design means not only creating a space that matches the teen's interests or keeps up with the latest trends. It also involves **proper space organization.** A great portion of growing up is school and learning – hence, the right space for studying is crucial for the room design. Don't forget that it's also the time when one's social life is in full bloom. Because of that, you should provide an intimate space for your teenager, where they could invite their friends - given that there is enough room. Finally, do not forget about a place for rest and regeneration of energy which is so important for a teen's proper development.

Apart from the general division of the available space, **there are other important issues to keep in mind, such as the lighting**. When you consider all those aspects, it might turn out that a teen room design is a very challenging task. It is not a surprise that many parents leave it to specialists. It doesn't mean, however, that you cannot inspire yourself by some teen bedroom ideas. You can show them later to an interior designer to give them the concept of what you expect.

## A teen bedroom with little space? Not an issue!

**The problem of too little space** is quite a common issue, especially in block apartments. Space management in such cases is much more difficult, but it is still achievable. You should use all the advantages provided by the shape of the room. If there are any niches – that's great news! You can put a closet, a desk, a small sofa or a bed in there, depending on the size of those objects.

The height of the room is another feature you want to use. If it's possible – you could turn the teen bedroom into a small split-level fancy interior. Obviously, this does not involve the whole available space. A good idea, however, is to **combine two levels of objects, for instance** **by putting** **a desk under a loft bed**. This solution requires a very good source of light under the desk.

If there is a wide windowsill in the room, you might use it as a seat. It might be a perfect spot for your teenager to relax and read a book.

## A teen girl bedroom ideas – what colors to choose?

Although popular trends usually use various shades of one color, you should be extra careful when choosing paint for a teen bedroom. **At this age, color preferences change rapidly** and it might turn out those beautiful yellow or blue walls have lost their initial charm only after several months from painting. In this scenario your teen is unsatisfied with their room and it is very likely that you have to make another renovation.

So, what colors to choose when designing a teen bedroom? **Neutral colors** are highly recommended – not necessarily white but various tones of beige or grey are great options.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
Choosing neutral colors does not automatically mean that a teen room will be boring. What's more, it's a solution that creates a lot of possibilities for accessorizing. One can change the decorations at any moment, so even if your child's taste changes, you don't have to renovate the whole interior.

## Original and practical ornaments that can improve a teen bedroom

If you are looking for teen bedroom ideas, you might want to focus on accesories that can act as practical ornaments. Wondering if that's possible? Covering one of the walls with a **magnetic or blackboard paint** is a great idea. You could also create a divided space - for instance over the desk so that the teenager can write a note on the wall or pin some photographs with their friends.

Another, quite an interesting idea involves a metal grate. One can use clips to attach some notes or already mentioned photos to it.

Such practical spots in a teen room **fit any style**, therefore thay can be used no matter what kind of project a teenager chooses.

## Teen room ideas – matching their interests

Practicality is only one aspect that a teen bedroom should contain. Another, equally important issue is **making the teen room distinct and characteristic.** One should not limit this aspect, but rather make a reasonable plan for it and choose the elements which will represent the main theme of a teen bedroom.

{:.list}
* If your teen is interested in **fantasy movies**, pick some movie posters that will hang on one of the walls.
* Does your teen **love painting**? Arrange a special spot for an easel or a hanger attached to the wall, where one can put canvas.
* Perhaps your child is **a fan of comic books**? Create a bookcase to organize the collection.

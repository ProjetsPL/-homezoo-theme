A white kitchen is a universal solution which gives you plenty of possibilities for design. One of them is putting **an unusual pattern on the wall**. White kitchen cabinets look perfect in combination with various types of tiles or even a wallpaper. Of course, if you decide to choose such elements, always check whether they are suitable for a kitchen. They should be grease- and water-resistant.

A white kitchen with **white tiles imitating a brick wall** has been a popular design over the years. Although this trend is still relevant, it appears in many new variations. White kitchens with white tiles and **colored grout** have become quite popular recently.

## A black and white kitchen – the secret lies in accessories

Kitchen cabinets can be easily matched with any accessory – but black is the most popular. It's a color that can enliven the room quite well.

**Darker shades are also excellent for the space located over the counters.** It's a solution recommended mostly for large kitchens, as it can make the interior look smaller. When choosing an overlay for the wall over a countertop, it's good to pick  a smooth texture. Why? Dark colors make any dirt highly visible, therefore, you are going to wipe the surface very often. Nevertheless – it looks incredibly elegant.

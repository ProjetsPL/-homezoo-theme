## Attic bathroom – what challenges does it pose?

An attic bathroom, according to many, poses many limitations. Large slopes, short walls and sometimes joists, depending on the building's plan. Obviously, on one hand those are quite difficult conditions, which do not make designing an attic bathroom any easier. On the other – you simply cannot change the structure of the room. The best idea, therefore, is to make those elements **a** **distinguishable feature** of your interior. It's a good way to get unusual and very stylish looking interiors.

## Ceiling slopes and their possibilities in an attic bathroom

**An attic bathroom** **does not necessarily mean that your possibilities are limited.** Keep in mind that the slopes, which in some situations are problematic, might create a lot of opportunities. In case of large spaces – they might be used for cupboards and shelves. You could keep towels, pajamas, cleaning supplies and cosmetics in them.

## A good space planning is key for an attic bathroom design

The possibilities created by an attic bathroom mostly depend on the space you have at your disposal. Although it seems that a big bathroom with a ceiling slope is easy to design, it might be very tricky – especially if you don't **plan your space well.** A small attic bathroom, on the other hand, requires a lot of skill and implementation of functional solutions that won't take too much space. For this reason attic bathroom design is often left to specialists, who know best how to fit such an interior to meet the needs of their clients.

## Attic bathroom design – lighting

Attic bathrooms often contain **roof windows**. Natural lighting is very important, as it creates the sense of spatiality of the interior and lifts the weight off the design. But what if an attic bathroom has no windows? In such a case make sure to pick the **proper artificial lighting**. A combination of plenty of light points, a mirror and some glass might create an interesting atmosphere.

Small attic bathrooms look perfect if you replace internal walls with glassbrick. Hollow glass bricks, which were not very popular in the recent years – are making a comeback.

## Making a small attic bathroom look bigger

Apart from the mentioned above method with the use of lighting, you can also **make the small attic bathroom visually bigger** by using certain design elements. The most popular trick involves using white color – on the floor, walls and furniture. Minimalism and **absolute white look** is a go-to design for anyone who doesn't know which style is the best for them. White can be matched with any accessory, making it easy to change the looks of the interior even several times a year.

A small attic bathroom doesn't like massive, highly ornamental furniture with carvings. Choose plain fronts instead. You can also give up handles and pick modern tip-on doors, which open by pressing on them.

## An attic bathroom with a bathtub? A great idea!

An attic bathroom is a perfect place for a bathtub. It is ideal for a sloped ceiling interior. If the amount of space allows for it, **you could choose a freestanding bathtub**, which is the best type for relaxation. If the small bathroom is too tiny for such a design, pick a small tub attached to the wall. An attic bathroom is becoming a popular design, so you shouldn't have any problems with finding the right accessories for it.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}

An attic bathroom with a shower stand is a more difficult solution, mostly due to the limited height and the slopes. Classic shower stalls are not suitable for an attic bathroom. If you have enough space – consider placing the shower in the center of the room. Such design, however, might be not very practical.

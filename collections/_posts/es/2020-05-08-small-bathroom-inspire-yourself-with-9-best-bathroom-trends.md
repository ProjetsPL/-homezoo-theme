## A small bathroom remodel: big ideas for a tiny bathroom

Not sure where to begin? Take a look at our ideas and design a **beautiful, fully functional interior**.

## Small bathroom themes – light color palette is always a good choice!

One of the most important factors that influence the **interior design** is it color. It's the major noticeable feature that reflects the character of the room. There is almost **unlimited number of available shades,** which gives you a lot of design possibilities. You might use the most basic colors, as well as prepare some unusual combinations.

When picking a color for a small bathroom, it is good to use delicate and bright shades, to avoid unnecessary chaos.

### Not only the walls! Unusual flooring in a tiny bathroom

Not only **wall color** is important in a small bathroom – you should also carefully **choose the flooring material**. First pick the type – tile, stone or boards, and then decide what color suits your needs. A small bathroom will benefit both from light and dark versions. If you choose dark flooring, it should contrast with the color of the walls. In such a case consider making the walls white.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
When looking for small bathroom ideas, avoid picking walls and flooring in the same color (except from white; in this case the rule does not apply). It is overwhelming for the room and makes it look smaller.

## Eco style small bathroom design

One of the most popular trends of the recent season is eco bathroom. **Eco can be characterized by a combination of the beauty of plain wood with classic colors.** The most common combinations are light wood (or its imitation in form of tiles) and plain, white walls. It's a very interesting design – elegant and minimalistic. This style is also perfect for a small bathroom decor. It can certainly add a lot of character to the room.

## Small bathroom decor with marble

A bathroom with marble tiles or accessories is a perfect design for anyone who loves **stylish and luxurious interiors**. Stone (or a good imitation) has a structure that makes the small bathroom look original and elegant.

Marble is perfect for **feminine glamour style interiors**, which look very classy. When arranging a small bathroom in this style, be careful not to overdo the textures and accessories. If you add too many decorations, the whole design might result in a cheap and kitschy look.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
If a marble bathroom is too expensive for you, just choose the cheaper option and lay special tiles that imitate stone. They have texture and pattern similar to marble, and they are much less expensive.

## Small bathroom design – how to make it look bigger?

Home interior design trends concern not only wall color or finishing materials. It is very important to choose the **right type of lighting** and lamps.

### Implication of illumination... it's trendy!

Lighting is a crucial aspect of a small bathroom design. It's important because small interior usually has little access to daylight. When choosing the right type of lighting, you should keep several issues in mind, such as:

{:.list}
* **Temperature (warm or cool lighting)** – temperature of illumination is important, as it influences its shade. Choosing warm light, you get a yellow shade which is perfect for rest and relaxation. Nevertheless, a cool white light is probably a better option for mirrors, as it imitates daylight and makes it easier to perform daily activities such as applying make-up and shaving.
* **Light source arrangement** – if you're preparing your own small bathroom design, arrange the lights so that they illuminate every important piece of equipment. The light by the mirror is the most important, allowing one to see the reflection clearly.

{% endfig %}

{:.list}
* **Light intensity** – depending on what you are aiming to achieve, consider the light intensity. Too dark lighting in a room without windows might be quite problematic and tiresome to use during daily activities.

**The angle of the light rays is also highly important.** A light source placed in the right place can make a tiny bathroom look significantly bigger, taking the "weight" off the interior.

The rule is simple – **choose as many sources of light as you can**. And, more importantly, match various types of lamps. You can play with different sizes – it's very popular lately.

### The bigger mirror, the better!

A good method for **making a small bathroom look larger** is hanging a large mirror on one of the walls. A mirror is a standard equipment of a bathroom anyway, so it's good to use its full potential.

Instead of picking small mirrors, choose large ones, that fill the majority of a wall or even the whole space. **Avoid mirrors with decorative frames and pick the ones with minimalistic and thin framing**  – **or with no frame at all.** This way you can create an illusion of depth, which will make the tiny bathroom look at least twice as big than it really is.

## A small bathroom in an apartment block – trendy tiles and equipment

A small bathroom in an apartment block has fewer possibilities for design. You might, however, choose an **interesting-looking equipment**. Elements like a bathtub, a shower, a sink and a toilet are essentials and you just cannot skip them in your project. For this reason you should choose functional solutions that will not overwhelm the room, **and that can give it a little character.**

A sink in an unusual shape, a dark color or **an extravagant, brass colored faucet**? Any accent that makes the small bathroom look unique will fit.

## A tiny bathroom with a shower – always trendy

A good way to spare space is installing a shower in your small bathroom. It's one of the more popular solutions among people living in small apartments. Remember that every bathroom is different – and there's plenty of shower models. Before making the final decision, estimate the potential of your interior.

One of the best types of showers for small bathrooms is **corner or asymmetrical shower stall.**

If you have tiles both on the floor and on walls, you might also decide to install a walk-in shower with only door and drain. It's one of the trendiest solutions, very often used in modern bathroom designs.

{% endfig %}

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
If you are afraid that your bathroom is too small to fit even the tiniest shower stall, you might also order a custom one. It's a little bit more expensive solution, however it allows you to fully use the available space.

## Small bathrooms with bathtubs – can they look stylish? Modernize the classic look

A bathtub usually takes a lot of space, therefore it is not the best design for a small bathroom. Still, it might be a better choice if a shower does not satisfy your needs – but you should plan your space sensibly.

When picking the right bathtub for a small bathroom, **pay special attention to its type and shape**. Avoid freestanding and classical bathtubs that have walls on each side. Both types take too much space. Instead, choose a square hydromassage tub. Their **walls often imitate natural wood.** It's a very innovative option, hence it's becoming popular among homeowners.

## Pallet - an idea for cheap furniture

Up until recently pallets were only used for product transportation. Nowadays pallets are commonly used for building various **home decoration** objects or even whole furniture sets. This solution fits trends of upcycling and zero-waste, which only contributes to its popularity.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
The main reason for which many homeowners decide to build their own pallet furniture sets is the **low price**. Objects such as pallet bed are a great solution if the budget is low.

It is surely advantageous for those furnishing their **first apartment** or renovating it for renting purposes. Pallet furniture are extremely easy to make and they do not require using any special tools. All one needs are several pallets, sanding paper or a grinder and products for wood protection. If the pallet bed or other furniture piece is going to have a particular colour, a good paint is also going to be needed.

Pallet is a common material that one can obtain for a low price or even for free. Ask at your local supermarket or a hardware shop whether they don’t have some spare pallets. You can also buy those elements directly in the factory or on online auction. They are not very expensive.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
When buying a pallet, remember to check its condition. A **pallet bed** made of damaged and chipped pallets is not very aesthetically pleasing.

## DIY pallet bed - step by step

A wood pallet bed is one of the most commonly assembled pallet furniture. It is not very difficult to make - you just need the right materials. It might be a good idea to prepare a **thorough project** before starting to assemble the parts. It might help to visualise how the complete piece should look, influencing the final outcome.

### What is needed for a pallet bed

Before beginning your work on a pallet bed, you should collect all needed materials. The most important elements are, obviously, pallets. The most popular pallet is **Euro-pallet** (also called EUR-pallet or EPAL pallet) with standard size 120x80 cm. Nevertheless, you can use pallets of different size. Plan the dimensions accordingly, to fit the mattress.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
Keep in mind that the pallet bed should be a little wider than the bedding, as it might move around when sleeping on it. A typical EUR-pallet weighs around 20 kg and can hold up to 1000 kg. You can choose lighter elements with a lower load limit - they will work for a pallet bed as well.

The number of pallets depends on your individual project. For a basic, one-person bed you need a minimum of three pallets. **Double bed** needs around six elements per one layer. Carefully plan how many layers you want and adjust the number of pallets you need. If you want to include a headboard in your project, you will need more pallets (depending on what the piece looks like).

Except from the pallets, you will also need:

{:.list.list-positive}

* a grinder tool,
* metal flat bars and long screws,
* wood protection - wood stain or a primer,
* paint - if the pallet bed is going to have a colour,
* paint brushes and rollers.

If you do not own a grinder and you cannot rent it, you might want to use **sanding paper or sponge**. Manual sanding takes considerably more time, however it might be more economic. It would make no sense to buy a new grinder only to sand your pallet bed.

### How to build a pallet bed?

Start your project from cleaning it. It is particularly important if the pallets you own were used for storage. First, **clean them** from dirt such as dust and mud. Then thoroughly sand all of the surfaces. If you use a grinder, start using a 60 grit paper, if sanding paper or sponge - 80. For the second smoothing, use a 120 grit. Wet the surface afterwards using a damp sponge. When it dries, the wood fibres will rise. The last sanding requires a 240 grit. After the surface is smoothed, dust it with a damp cloth.

The next step involves joining the elements. Use metal **flat bars and screws** for this purpose. Lay the pallets on the floor, and join them. It is irrelevant at what spot you link the pallets. You can place the screws at the bottom (if you decide to do it, secure them with an additional layer of felt, to prevent scratching the floor). You might also place them on sides or on top - you decide whether they are visible or not.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
When planning a wood pallet bed, think of additional elements, such as **headboard or legs**. If they are included in your plan, now it’s time to build them and attach to the bed.

The last stage involves painting the newly designed piece. If you want to keep the natural wood pattern, just cover the surface with wood stain or varnish. You might also decide to give your bed a colour - in such case just use good paint in a chosen colour. You might also use a **coloured wood stain**, which will create an interesting effect.

## Pallet bed - what mattress is best?

A wood pallet bed is just a platform on which a mattress lays. How **comfortable** is a bed depends on a good mattress. It should be suited to your individual needs. One’s sleeping position, weight and the number of people sleeping on a bed - those are are factors that should be considered when buying a mattress. The size is also a very important issue - you should fit the pallet bed to the mattress, not vice versa.

If the pallet bed is going to stand in a guest room, it is best to choose a universal product. You might choose, for instance, a **foam mattress** that fits any body shape.

## Pallet furniture - ideas

Wood pallet bed is only one of many ideas for pallet furniture. There are many interesting solutions that one can use. They are worth trying, as they are simple and easy to make.

Objects that you might make are for instance:

{:.list.list-positive}

### Pallet dog bed

Your pets can also use pallet furniture. To make a bed for them, you might build a big box, using pallet boards. You can go even simpler - just smooth the surface of a pallet and put a cushion or a mattress on it.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
When you create pallet furniture, think of the multifunctionality. You might add elements such as wheels, or in case of tables - glass tops. Construction of Euro-pallets allows to create **drawers**, which are useful for storing additional items.

### Preparing the surface

Before you can **cover your wood paneling** with paint, you should pay attention to its surface. The boards shall be cleaned from dirt and dust. The old layers of paint and varnish must be thoroughly sanded - this way the fresh paint will stick better to the surface.

**Sanding the old surface** is essential if you want to keep the natural look of the wood. If the old layers peel and fall off the surface, they need to be removed completely by thorough sanding. Otherwise just smoothening the boards is enough.

To **smoothen or clean** the boards use coarse sanding paper. For large surfaces, it is good to use a disc grinder (polishing machine). Under no circumstance use wire brushes, as they could seriously damage the wooden surface of the boards.

After finishing the sanding, the room should be thoroughly vacuumed. **Wipe the wood paneling with a damp cloth** to remove dust from them. Any dents and holes should be filled with wood adhesive.

### Painting wood paneling - where to start?

One of the most important matters when **painting wood paneling** is following the paint manufacturer’s instructions. When using acrylic paint, it is advised to apply a wood primer beforehand. Such product **protects the wood paneling**, reduces the paint absorption and improves its adhesion to the surface. It is best to choose a product from the same manufacturer as the paint you are going to use for your wood paneling.

You may start **painting the wood paneling** right after the primer dries.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}

If the boards are narrow, a small brush will suffice; to paint wider paneling, use a paint roller.

**The paint dries quickly** - you can apply the next layers approximately after an hour. Wood paneling requires 2-3 layers of paint.

### How to paint wood paneling without sanding the surface?

**Sanding the wood paneling** is time consuming and removing the old layers of paint or varnish might be quite difficult. It is possible, however, to paint wood paneling without the necessity of smoothing the boards. In such a case it is best to use chalk paint, as it sticks well to every type of surface. Such paint dries substantially quicker than other types - in most cases one can apply another layer after 20 minutes.

Chalk paint used for wood paneling is useful if you plan to distress the wooden boards. After using the paint remember to cover your paneling with a protective layer of varnish or wax.

## Painted wood paneling - white or colour?

Bright colours are perfect for enlightening a room and making it visually bigger. Such shades are the best choice for narrow hallways and foyers. This is where you can most often find wood paneling on the wall. Painting paneling gives a lot of possibilities in this case. The home interior design will look really good.

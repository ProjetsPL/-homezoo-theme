### Size of the pot is not proportional to size of the plant

Potting and repotting of peace lily is also very important. The belief that a plant potted in a larger box grows better is wrong. Putting lily plants in too large pots might cause a problem with their blooming. Therefore, you should choose a box that is perfectly proportional to the plant you are going to transplant.

You shouldn't transplant peace lilies too often, as it also disturbs their blooming and growth. Having that in mind, repotting should be done only when it's absolutely necessary, e.g. when the pot is too small or it has been damaged.

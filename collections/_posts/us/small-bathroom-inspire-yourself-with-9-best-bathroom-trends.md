### Not only the walls! Unusual flooring in a tiny bathroom

In a small bathroom not only **wall color** is important – you should also carefully **choose the floor**. Starting from the type of flooring – tiles, stone, boards, and finishing on the color. A small bathroom will benefit both from light and dark version. Although if you choose dark flooring, it should contrast with the color of the walls. In such a case consider white walls.

Looking for small bathroom ideas, avoid picking walls and flooring in the same color (except from white, in which case this rule does not apply). It is overwhelming for the room and makes it look smaller.

## Why cleaning the washing machine is important?

Cleaning your washing machine is crucial, as most of its components are in constant **contact with dirt** coming off the clothes. They are also **exposed to water**, which leads to forming limescale on the heating element, drum and filters. If left to such state, the machine might start to malfunction. The heater is going to take more time to warm up the water. Pressure in the tubes can weaken because of the scale accumulating inside.

If the limescale is not removed regularly, the mentioned parts will eventually get broken. Repairing a broken device generates additional costs. It is often the case that fixing the broken elements is simply too expensive, therefore it might be more economic to replace the whole machine. Having that in mind, one can assume that **cleaning the washing machine saves it from a serious breakdown**.

### What will happen if the washing machine is not cleaned regularly?

If you neglect cleaning the washing machine, the continuous contact with water, warm environment and poor ventilation inside of it will create perfect conditions for organisms such as yeast and fungi. Mold is **very dangerous for human health**, as it releases toxic substances into the air. 

They can cause problems with:

* respiratory system,

Yeast occupying your washing machine might be the cause of an **unpleasant smell**, which might affect the laundry. **Thorough and systematic cleaning** of the washing machine will prevent the aforementioned issues.

## Before you start changing colors of the room

Even the most beautiful and stunning colors cannot look good without a **thorough preparation**. If you neglect that step, the wall paint will look sloppy and, what's worse - the color won't stay for long. Having that in mind, make sure to prepare the walls and the rest of the room before you decide how to paint it.

**Wall painting is a specific type of activity that requres a lot of space.** In addition, paint dripping from a brush might damage your furniture or other objects that stand nearby. For this reason you should start wall painting from **removing everything from the room.** If you are not able to take everything out, take care of the remaining elements. Cover every surface, along with the floor, using plastic covers. This way the interior is protected against accidental paint splatters.

To make wall painting easier, you may stick the cover to the surface using masking tape. This secures the sheet from moving around when you paint. You might also use the covers to determine the color edge or to hide wall fragments that you are not going to paint.

### Preparing the wall for painting

Preparing the walls is a crucial step in the process of painting a room. Without it, even the most brilliant wall colors cannot be aesthetic and lasting. To make sure that the surface is suitable for painting, tap at the walls you want to paint. If you hear a characteristic sound of a "hollow wall", it means that you probably should remove the old and apply a new plaster layer. This way you can be sure that the colors will stay for long.

If your walls are covered with wallpaper, remove it as well. Otherwise it might soak during wall painting. As a result the paper might start to roll and fold, which is very unaesthetic. **Even the most trendy wall paint cannot save the day in such case.**

How to paint a room that has been covered with a very opaque paint? Removing such a layer is not easy, however it is possible. **Regardless, the process requires a lot of dedication and patience.** Avoid forceful scraping, as it might damage the plaster. To make your task easier, use special products available on the market.

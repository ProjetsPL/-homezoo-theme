The next step is priming the wall that is going to be plastered. If the surface has low absorptiveness, use a product that increases adhesiveness. If the absorption is high, use something that reduces it.

To mix the plaster up, take a bucket with water and pour substance in it - adjust the amount so that you can work approximately for 30-45 minutes. It is very highly important - **plaster loses its flexibility with time**. Wait for several minutes and mix the plaster thoroughly using a drill.

### Wall plastering - how to plaster a wall?

Start from putting the plaster onto the external corners. **Use a float for application** and a trowel for spreading on the surface. After finishing the corners, spread the plaster onto the whole wall. If you're planning to plaster the whole room, apply the material onto the ceiling as well.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}

Specialists suggest puting just one layer of plaster. If needed, you may apply two or three thin layers. Wait approximately 20 minutes between each application. Every new layer should be applied perpendicularly to the previous one.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}

To achieve the best results, start painting no sonner than 24 hours after the plaster dries.

Wet plastering is a very popular method for a quick finish. It involves applying a layer of plaster onto the first layer that has not dried completely. This method requires **extra caution**, however it significantly speeds up the work.

After the two layers dry, you can smoothen the surface with water instead of using sand paper. Just dampen the wall with clean water and then smoothen it using a steel float. Make sure the second layer is dry before starting with this method.

## Charcoal - what color is it, exactly?

**Charcoal color** is sometimes called graphite or anthracite color. For some people it's a dusky shade associated with **coal made of wood** or hard, mined coal and other sedimentary rocks. In HEX color code charcoal is known as #364135, in RAL - 7016. Charcoal is a **unique mixture** of grey and black.

Charcoal color is very intriguing. Why is it so popular? It is very close to black, however it is noticeably brighter. It's one of the darkest tones of gray - and this feature makes it special.

Although this type of color recently became very popular, it might be quite difficult to use in interior arrangement. Combining **charcoal with other home decor elements** should be done very carefully and skillfully. The reason for that is the fact that a color that is too dark can easily overwhelm a room. Charcoal works best in spacious and well illuminated interiors. If the room is quite small, it does not mean that you should avoid the color. In this case instead of painting the walls it is better to use charcoal accessories.

If your home is spacious but you have no idea how to use charcoal - refer to the help of a specialist. Contact a competent person, explain them what exactly you expect and **wait for a project fitted for your needs.** This solution is becoming increasingly popular among those who want to use charcoal color in their homes.

{% endfig %}

As mentioned before, charcoal is quite a universal shade. For this reason it can be easily suited to basically any interior design. It fits modern styles, such as **scandinavian, industrial and minimalistic**. If combined well, charcoal can make a room look special and unique, accentuating particular elements.

## Charcoal walls - a good idea?

Charcoal is a color that looks perfect on walls - both in a house and in a small apartment. The only thing is to use it carefully and tastefully.

Charcoal was rarely used as a wall color in the past. The dark shade could have seemed not very interesting and too strong. If used well, however, charcoal can be perfect for any type of interior.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
It’s a highly adaptable color, which can be used in any modern style rooms - in kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms and offices.

{% endfig %}

Charcoal works best as a wall colour in spacious and bright interiors. Such a room should be well illuminated with lots of natural light. The best rooms in which you can use charcoal paint are located on **eastern, south-eastern and western side** of a building. You shouldn’t paint northern rooms with charcoal paint - they might look too dark and cold in such arrangements. In such cases it is better to combine the shade with brighter ones.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
If the room is very small, you shouldn’t paint the walls charcoal. Such a dark shade would overwhelm the already small space. A better idea is to paint the walls in different, brighter color that makes the room look bigger. You can use charcoal accessories instead - as accent elements.

Wallpapers are becoming trendy again and manufacturers offer a lot of interesting designs, also charcoal. A good product with a nice texture might be a nice decoration for your room.

Instead of using an ordinary paint, you could use a chalkboard paint in charcoal color. Thanks to this solution you can write on walls with chalk, which might be useful in places such as kitchen, office and children’s room.

### Accessories for dark walls

If the walls are painted charcoal, it is best to choose furniture and decorations in contrasting colors. The safest complimentary colors are white, beige, and also strong black. Charcoal also works well with light brown - therefore it is good to choose accessories in the color of natural wood. It is a particularly good solution for an interior in **scandinavian style**, which favours natural textures.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
A highly intriguing idea for a living room with charcoal walls is a sofa in a strong color, for instance blue or yellow. It makes the room look more vivid, and **charcoal walls bring out the strong color of the sofa**.

## Charcoal grey for a children's room? Only in a good combination!

Are you looking for ideas to furnish your child’s room? Although charcoal is very versatile, it is definitely not suitable for a toddler’s room. **It is simply too dark and difficult to integrate into this type of interior.** If you are not afraid of risk, choose delicate pastels and bright colors, and match them with charcoal accesories. You can ask a specialist to make you a project based on your preferences.

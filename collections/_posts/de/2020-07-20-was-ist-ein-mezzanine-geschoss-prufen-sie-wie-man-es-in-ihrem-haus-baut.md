## What is a mezzanine? Can I employ it in my house?

Mezzanine is an intermediate level built in between two floors of a building, usually on the ground level. It might consist of **one or several rooms**. It is mostly used in large industrial buildings, shopping centers and restaurants, although it might also be built in a private house. A mezzanine might serve as a **home office** or **a bedroom**. 

### Entresol in your house – what should you pay attention to?

A mezzanine floor at home is a **very practical and functional solution**. Without keeping certain safety measures it might be, however, dangerous for people living in the house. Before designing a mezzanine, first pay attention to the entrance. Stairs are important – whether winding or straight, a sturdy banister is a must, to ensure stability and protection from slipping.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
If the mezzanine will not be used by children, you might install a ladder instead of a staircase. Remember that it has to be stable.

Another important aspect is **railing**. You might use traditional or modern glass rails. This way you can create a room resembling a balcony. Another, much safer (especially for children) solution is fencing the mezzanine with a pony wall.

**A mezzanine floor also needs to be illuminated – it needs a separate set of lights**. The type of lighting is irrelevant and it depends solely on the home owners' preference, as well as on the purpose of the mezzanine. You might use a standard hanging lamp, wall lights or floor lamp.

### How high should a mezzanine be?

A mezzanine at home is a great way to spare some space, especially if the apartment is small. Keep in mind that a **mezzanine makes sense only in high ceiling homes**. It is great in old buildings such as tenements. If the interior is short, like, for instance block apartments, a mezzanine will only overwhelm it.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
To get a comfortable space both over and under the mezzanine, the apartment's height should be at least 4.2 meters.

In a lower ceiling room, you might build a **mezzanine bedroom**. In this case the mezzanine height might be 1.2 meters. Such an entresol can be built in a room that is about 3.5 meters tall. A minimal safe height for a room with a mezzanine is 2.6 meters.

## How to build a mezzanine? A step by step guide

You should start building a mezzanine from designing a good project. Because such a construction is specified in the building code, it is a good idea to **ask a professional for help**. This way you can be sure that your project is congruous with the law. To design the mezzanine, take appropriate measurements in the room in which it is going to be built.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
When doing a project, take the electrics into consideration. Make sure to include a power socket and a good lighting in the mezzanine.

Another step is purchasing all the necessary materials. **A mezzanine floor is typically made of wood, so you might, for instance, visit a lumber mill**. Show your project to the employees, and they will know what exactly you expect.

The most important part of **building a mezzanine** floor is drilling holes and installing the beams that hold the whole construction. You can do it yourself, based on building guides. If you want to **be absolutely sure that the mezzanine is 100 percent safe** **and well constructed**, commission a specialist to do it for you. A professional will prepare and attach the beams to the wall, as well as secure the whole construction. The beams should be finished off and then plastered.

{% endfig %}

The final step is **securing the floor** to the beams and fitting a staircase or a ladder.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
Remember to leave small spaces between the floor panels. Humidity in the room changes constantly, causing the wood to expand or shrink in volume. The spaces help with the proper ventilation.

## Disadvantages of a mezzanine floor

Although a mezzanine level **looks interesting in a house**, it is also quite a demanding solution. Many homeowners who decide to build an entresol, ignore important issues and possible problems that should be kept in mind.

One of the biggest issues is **heating of a house with a mezzanine floor**. Warm air flows upwards, which causes the necessity to turn up the heating. Only this way the temperature on the lower level, where one spends significantly more time, will be optimal. Also, because the heat accumulates not on, but under the ceiling, using the mezzanine in winter might be problematic – the air up there might be simply too hot and dry. 

**Keeping the same temperature level in the room and in the mezzanine floor is practically impossible**. For this reason one of the interiors will always be too cold or too hot.

Another problem might be caused by the **unusual construction of a mezzanine** floor. Being an open space, it is not fully enclosed, therefore it does not isolate sounds. Music, TV sound or conversations can be heard around the house, which might disturb the peace and privacy.

Despite several cons, a mezzanine floor is a **very good solution** that might make your home far more functional.

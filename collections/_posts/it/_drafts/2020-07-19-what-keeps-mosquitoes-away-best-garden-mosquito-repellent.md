## Can a natural mosquito repellent replace store-bought products?

Natural mosquito control methods might be as effective as some store-bought products. The only thing that needs to be kept in mind is the **right preparation and proper usage** of such remedies. The most popular method is using essential oils for mosquito repellent, whose strong scent scare the insects away. They are for instance:

{:.list.list-positive}

* lemon grass oil – it also repels flies and gnats,
* clove oil,
* patchouli oil,
* eucalyptus oil, especially the one made from lemon-scented gum (_Corymbia citriodora_).

You can easily prepare a homemade **mosquito repellent spray** with **essential oils**, which is a natural equivalent of store-bought chemical products. To make a homemade mosquito repellent you need: a mixture of essential oils that have insect repellent qualities and **base oil** (i.e. vegetable oil, for instance the one you typically use in the kitchen: sunflower, almond or grapeseed oil).

A **homemade mosquito repellent** is very easy to make. All you need to do is combine essential oils of your choice with the base oil in the right proportion and mix them well. For 100 ml of your base oil you should use no more than 10 ml of essential oil (keep that in mind especially when using several various essential oils).

Keep the mixture in **dark glass containers**, for instance in small bottles.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
For the best effectiveness, apply your homemade mosquito repellent every 2 hours onto spots that are the most vulnerable to bites.

Not only flowering perennials repel mosquitoes. Another brilliant method for natural mosquito control is planting certain species of **trees and shrubs**. One of the most hated trees among mosquitoes is staghorn sumac. The tree can help you get rid of mosquitoes from your garden. It takes very little space and requires minimal effort, so it's a plant that anyone can manage – even if you barely started your gardening adventure.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}

## What keeps mosquitoes away? Learn 3 proven mosquito repellents for your garden

Sprinkling your clothes or **spraying your body with special mosquito repellent solutions is effective but short-lasting**. This process typically has to be repeated several times a day. What are the best methods to keep the mosquitoes out of your garden and stop them from ruining your evenings? Check our suggestions that will help you win the battle with mosquitoes.

### Essential oils and mosquito repellent sprays

The most popular method for fighting mosquitoes is using various mosquito sprays, essentail oils or a mosquito repellent candle. **You can combine all those methods, which will make them more effective.** You should, however, keep in mind that those remedies only hold back and repel the insects, instead of fully eliminating the problem.

**Incense sticks, candles and torches,** although effective, they are very limited timewise. Such products protect against the insects only when you are staying right by the source. The further you are from the mosquito repellent candle or stick, the more you are vulnerable to bites. For this reason, even **if you decided to burn an incense stick, do not forget to use a repellent oil or spray as well.**

One of the most popular mosquito repellents for gardens involves installing a **special type of lighting**. There are certain outdoor lamps that help you combat the insects. It does not only repel, but also **completely eliminates the flying insects**.

{% fig %}

**A lamp of this type emits subtle ultraviolet lighting**, which pulls the insects regardless of the season. One of the most common types of lamps are the ones that eliminate the mosquitoes by electrocuting them. Another method makes the insects stick to the lamp and the device sucks them inside. **The method of luring the mosquitoes remains the same in both devices, while the way they are eliminated is different.**

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
A great advantage of such a lamp is the fact that it doesn't affect people standing nearby. For this reason it's a perfect solution for allergy sufferers, who cannot use popular mosquito repellent sprays.

## Garden spraying – a sure mosquito control method

The last step in the fight with mosquitoes is **spraying your garden**. By using the right type of mosquito repellent, you can scare away and eliminate the insects dwelling in your garden.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
If you want to get rid of several types of insects, you can mix two different mosquito repellent sprays. Remember to keep the proportions in balance.

Garden mosquito spray is nothing else than a **concentrated insect repellent**, mixed a moment before using it. Apply it mostly in dark, damp spots and on tall grasses. Due to the fact that mosquitoes are less active in the morning and in the late evening, the spray might help you decrease their population or completely hinder their reproduction. The larger area you spray, the more effective the method is. Nevertheless, **use the spray responsibly**, remembering about the right proportions. A chemical mosquito repellent is a sure way to win the fight with those insects.

## What about mosquitoes by the water?

To prevent mosquitoes reproduction in your garden, you need to make sure that the water in the reservoir is constantly moving. It's very important because **fresh, standing water is a place where the insects lay eggs.** You can produce water movement very easily, for instance by adding fountains, streams or a cascade to your pond. It's an easy way to prevent the mosquitoes from reproducing, by stopping them from laying eggs.

Because **mosquitoes typically choose foul, dense and shallow water bodies**, you should take care of the water plants and clean the pond regularly.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
Some fish and frog species feed on insect larvae. Keeping them in your garden pond might prevent mosquitoes from reproducing.

## Find a good backing – a wooden TV wall

As for a TV wall with wood, you have several possibilities when it comes to design. You can lay the whole wall with wooden panels or cover just a part of it – only where the device is going to be placed. In such a case you can order specially designed panels. All you need to do is to make a basic project and the specialist is going to know what you expect.

If you have the wooden elements customised for you, consider adding another functionality to the wall. You could ask for making side shelves to the main panel, for instance to make a display of your movies collection.

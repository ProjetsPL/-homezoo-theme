## Why does my orchid not bloom? Learn 3 most common reasons

Orchids are demanding plants, therefore they might not bloom properly if they are not taken care of. **Your orchid doesn't bloom?** Use the tricks listed below and learn how to revive an orchid.

### Improperly pruned orchids

One of the reasons why an orchid doesn't bloom is the **wrong way of trimming** the plant or not doing it at all. Flowers that finished blossoming should be cut off, snipping them above the third bud. It can result in **rich blooming.** Some species, however, do not like trimming, which might lead to hindering the blooming process.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
An orchid species that should not be trimmed is Phalaneopsis – so called moth orchid. In this case you should wait for the flowers to die back and then safely remove them.

### Too low temperature

An important factor that influences orchids blooming is **temperature and lighting** that they are kept in. Orchids grow best in warm temperatures – for this reason they should grow in temperature no lower that **22°C (71 F)**. Improper temperature not only hinders blooming but also may make it grow slower and cause the leaves to grow smaller.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
Some species are adapted to extremely low temperatures in winter. For instance Dendrobium Mobile blooms in temperatures between 5 and 10 Celsius degrees (41 and 50 F) and might grow slow if it's placed in a too warm room.

### Wrong orchid fertilizer

Another reason for poor blooming of your orchids is **wrong plant food**. Orchids should be fed with special mixes, as ornamental plants need fertilizer to be diluted with water. The quantity of the substance is also very important. To little might lead to important nutrients deficit, while too much can cause roots overgrowth. **Fertilize your orchids with a small dose of the substance, 2-3 times per week.**

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
When the plant is hibernating, do not use fertilizer at all. When the orchid is blooming, use it more frequently.

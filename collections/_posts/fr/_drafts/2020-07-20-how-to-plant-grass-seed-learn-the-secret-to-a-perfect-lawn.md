## What is self-repairing grass and how dies it work?

**Self-repairing grass is a real gardening phenomenon.** What makes it different from any other type of grass seed is the unique growth and spreading process.

Self-repairing grass seed can grow several blades out of a single grain, and then they start to spread. It happens both vertically and horizontally, forming **thick bunches of grass**. Traditional types of grass also form bunches that spread, however their number remains the same. Self-repairing grass seed makes the lawn think and lush in a very short time.

Self-repairing grass makes great surface for a heavily used lawn. For this reason it's a perfect solution for a garden with children. This type of grass seed is also very resistant to atmospheric condition, so it can survive heavy rains and freezes.

Good quality self-repairing grass seed might cost even twice as much as other types. When choosing a particular brand, you have to decide whether your primary criterion is the quality or quantity.

The size of the bag is crucial as well. A one-kilogram package of self-repairing grass seed might be sufficient for a small garden, it is definitely not enough for a large garden.

## How to plant grass seed? Preparing the ground

The process of ground preparation before planting grass seed consists of several steps. It's very important for growth of the grass. The first what you need to do is **tidying the site**. You should gather the scraps and rubbish left on it and do the weeding. All those factor might affect the acidity of the soil and influence the grass seed growth.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
If the site is not cleaned up thoroughly, it might result in poor growth of the grass; it might grow yellow or dry.

Another step in the process of soil preparation is **breaking the ground and testing its acidity**. It's a good indicator for which type of grass seed you should choose for a particular type of soil. For the best results, the soil should be fertile, airy, and it should have moderate humidity.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
The acidity can be tested in two ways – by sending a sample to a lab or by using a special acidimeter. THe best acidity of a soil for grass seed is 5.5 – 6.5 pH.

Make sure to **fertilize the soil** for a week before planting the grass seed. To do this, use a starter or a universal fertilizer. You can purchase both at a garden center. Mix it with the soil according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The last, but equally important step of preparing the soil before planting grass seed is **rolling the ground**. It helps to even the surface for planting and thickens the soil.

## Planting grass seed – how to do it?

A popular and quick method for planting grass seed is doing it **manually**. It involves seeding the grain yourself. To do this, you should **divide the prepared ground for several even parts**.

When planting grass seed, it is advised to **do it crosswise**. This way the grain is evenly distributed, and the grass can reach optimal density. To make things easier, start seeding in one direction, and as you come back, spread the rest in opposite. Rake the ground thoroughly afterwards. It helps to cover the seeds with soil, which will protect the sprouts from weather conditions.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
An important step is solidifying the soil after planting grass seed. You can do it using a flat board. It secures the seed from being blown away by the wind.

Another, very important part is **watering the lawn.** To do it correctly, pour a small stream of water onto the ground. The easiest way is using a garden hose. Water the lawn regularly for two weeks after planting grass seed. The best time for watering the lawn is very early morning or late evening, when there is no sun which could burn the seedlings. Regular watering makes the lawn and its roots grow faster.

## When to plant grass seed?

If you want your lawn to be **green and lush**, try planting grass seed in particular months. When to plant grass seed so that it grows fast and well?

Most of the grass seed species require planting in autumn. It's the best season, mostly due to **weather and soil conditions**, characteristic for this part of the year. Planting grass seed from August to October protects the seeds from heavy rainfalls and high temperatures. Additionally, the soil humidity encourages the grass to sprout and grow.

**Another good season for planting grass seed is early spring.** The best period to do this is between April and June. The weather conditions are the most important factor, so pay attention not only to a particular month, but also to the temperature. In case of early spring freezes you should probably postpone planting grass seed until autumn.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
Some garden owners decide to plant grass seed in March. It is, however, not the best idea from the gardening point of view. Although there are some species that are resistant to atmospheric conditions – for instance some types of ornamental grasses, planting grass seed so early might result in poor growth.

## The most common mistakes made when planting grass seed

When you prepare your lawn, you should pay close attention to every detail of the process. First and foremost, remember about all the rules – for **preparing the ground, seeding and further lawn care.** Very often even the smallest mistakes might affect the proper growth of grass.

**The most commonly made mistakes are:**

{:.list.list-negative}

* **Incorrectly prepared soil** and not removing all elements that might affect the growth.
* **Not loosening the soil** – which helps with the removal of the remainders of plants that used to grow in the area.
* **Insufficient removal of any weeds from the area** on which you are going to plant grass seed. If there is a lot of weeds, you might need to use an herbicide, which will remove the plants from the soil.
* **Not enriching the soil** – some types of soil require additional fertilizing. It is particularly important in case of sandy soils, where you should use a special peat mix or compost.
* **Choosing wrong grass seed**, that is not suitable for garden lawn, but rather for meadow grass.
* **Uneven planting,** which results in an unaesthetic looking lawn.
* **Not securing the seed after planting**, especially when the weather is windy, which might blow the seed away.
* **Insufficient amount of water**, which hinders the seeds from sprouting and growing properly.

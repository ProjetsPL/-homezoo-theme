To make **painting kitchen furniture** more convenient, remove the front elements and take out all drawers. Wash the furniture with water and a detergent. Make sure to **degrease all surfaces**, wiping them with acetone or gasoline. Every handle and knob should be removed for painting.

Sanding the kitchen furniture is an important step before starting to paint it. For this purpose use sanding paper or sponge. Sanding makes paint stick better to the surface. If your furniture is painted or varnished, 240 grit paper will suffice. If you’re **painting laminate furniture**, use 400 grit paper. Make sure to be very careful with sanding, as laminate is easy to damage.

### Tools for restoring kitchen furniture

**Painting kitchen furniture** requires using the right tools. They are a guarantee of a smooth and even surface.

**Round or flat bristle paint brush** is suitable only for chalk paint. Using a brush for other types of paint might result in unaesthetic trails on the surface. It is therefore advised to use a wide paint roller to paint large surfaces such as fronts and sides. Foam and flock rollers are the best tools for **painting furniture**.

{:.warning}
Do not use sheepskin roller, as it leaves fibres and creates a rough texture on the painted surface. For the most even surface use a spray gun.

### Painting kitchen furniture

After proper preparation of your **kitchen furniture**, you can start painting it. Before covering the surface with paint, use the primer. The product should come from the same manufacturer as the paint you use. It is a guarantee that paint and primer work well with each other.

After the primer dries, you can paint the furniture. Using previously mentioned **wide roller** is the most convenient. For small elements and hard to reach spaces use a small brush. Cover the surface with at least two layers. The time of drying and the number of layers depend mainly on the paint and its brand.

{:.tip}
A standard number is **two layers** of paint. It is best to apply the paint with a criss-cross method: paint the first layer horizontally, and the second - diagonally. If you see that two layers are not enough, apply more layers, until the paint covers the furniture completely.

Make sure that the layers are **as thin as possible**. This will result in an even and smooth surface. Remember that paint needs up to 20 days to fully cure. Before it happens, be careful not to damage the delicate surface. If you need to clean it, use a **soft cloth or a sponge**.

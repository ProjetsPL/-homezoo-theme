A great many of DIY projects can be made of **plain paper.** This cheap material is quite versatile and therefore highly popular amongst handicraft lovers. Paper can be used for practically anything - from painting to sculpting.

Some home decor ideas involving paper:

* **Lamp shades - they can be prepared with the use of origami techniques - there are many step-by-step instructions in the web. You can also cut some shapes out of paper and combine them into a ball using glue. Poking a pattern of holes in a solid paper lamp shade will result in a very interesting lighting in a room.**
* **Decorative garlands** - paper chains are decorations suitable not only for Christmas and parties, as many might think. They can be utilized throughout the entire year. Just cut some interesting shapes out of coloured **construction paper**, attach them to a string and hang them anyplace you want. You can also use crêpe paper, which creates very aesthetic forms, for instance **flowers, pom poms and fringe.**
* **3D paper sculpture - a very impressive and quite easy to make DIY project. To make it, you need some paper, scissors and glue. The paper needs to be folded in such a way so that a solid figure is made. Every such element is glued onto a wall, side by side.

## DIY - atmospheric lighting in your house

Apart from the paper lampshades, there are many more DIY projects involving **atmospheric** **lighting in the room.** You can use anything - for instance old Christmas lights, which can be used as a year-long decoration. Some DIY ideas for Christmas lights are:

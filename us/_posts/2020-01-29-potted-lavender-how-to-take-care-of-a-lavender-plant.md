### How to plant lavender in a pot?

Regardless of the type of your plant, all species have similar requirements. Potted lavender needs more attention than the one growing directly in soil, as it has less space to grow.

Lavender plant should grow in a big container. It is advised to use ceramic pots, as they **allow water to naturally evaporate**. With plastic containers there is risk that water will stay inside. Make sure to put a drainage layer at the bottom of the planter, along with drain holes. Lavender does not tolerate excessive wetness. The best soil for a lavender plant is dry, lightweight, **rich in calcium and alkaline or neutral**. You can use universal potting soil mixed with sand in 1:1 proportions or buy a special lavender soil in a flower shop. After planting a new plant cover its roots with additional layer of soil.

Lavender in a pot grows best in sunny spots - choose windows facing south and west. The plant likes wind, so don’t worry if the place is draughty. In summer you can place the pot on a balcony or on a patio.

{:.distinction.distinction-information}
You can also try to seed the plant. The seeds need to be **stratified** first (for around two months). To do this, you might mix them with sand, put them in a fridge, and plant them in spring. The young plants bloom after a year. Their colours might differ from the parent plant.

## Lavender plant care guide

Lavender is a plant that **does not like to stand in shade**. Excessive wetness is also not good for it. Water it 1-2 times a week. Make sure not to overwater the lavender, or it might stop growing. It is better to leave the soil to dry a little instead - although do not let it dry completely. Fertilise the soil every two weeks from April to July. A liquid fertilizer is best for this purpose.

Lavender needs pruning. Do it approximately twice a year to keep the good look of the plant. Such procedure also prolongs blooming time. While you can cut up to half the length, it is best to **cut back 2/3 of a branch**.

Lavender also needs to hibernate. For this purpose move the plant to a room with lower temperature. Don’t forget to water it, otherwise the plant will die. Lavender is not very popular among vermins - its strong smell works as a natural repellent. The plant can be transplanted into a new spot after it stops blooming.

{:.distinction.distinction-warning}
The only disease that may attack a lavender plant is **botrytis** (a type of fungus). It will occur if the plant is overwatered. To prevent it, don’t let the roots soak too much. Pour the water out of the saucer immediately, so that it is not sucked back into the soil.
